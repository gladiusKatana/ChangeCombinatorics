//  countWaysToMakeChange(efficient-recursive).playground
//  1st commit Apr. 24, 2019  ‚àô  Created by Garth Snyder (a.k.a. gladiusKatana ‚öîÔ∏è)


//$ counts the number of ways to make up a given sum with change, using a given number of types of coins (assuming all types are available, up to a given denomination ‚Äî picture a bank-sized cash registerüè¶)

//  the algorithm is made more efficient by setting the parameter 'boosted' to true, which implements a lookup table (a dictionary, with 2-tuples as keys) to tabulate values returned from pairs of parameters (amount, denominations) that the function was already called with; thus are the redundant tree recursion recalculations avoided.

//  (It's kind of neat, if you haven't seen Xcode playgrounds in action before, to see running processes being tracked (especially during slower computations -- to do one, call  countWaysToMakeChange(:), with  boosted: false, and a fairly large value of  amount. Pull the dark-grey sidebar (at-right) leftward to display frequencies of calls.)

/*  Inspired by an example from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (section 1.2.2, "Counting change": https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.2
 
 
    Here is the same procedure in Scheme (no lookup table though, presently):

 
 
 (define (countWaysToMakeChange amount) ; using somewhat Swifty naming, ie camelCase etc.
    (define (cwc amount denominations)
      (define (amountsOfLargestUsed denominations)
        (cond ((= denominations 1) 1)
              ((= denominations 2) 5)
              ((= denominations 3) 10)
              ((= denominations 4) 25)
              ((= denominations 5) 100)))
      (cond ((or (< amount 0) (= denominations 0)) 0)
            ((= amount 0) 1)
            (else (+ (cwc amount
                          (- denominations 1))
                     (cwc (- amount
                             (amountsOfLargestUsed denominations))
                          denominations)))))
    (cwc amount 5))
 

 
 ; And here is the Scheme implementation I use (nice open-source REPL): https://download.racket-lang.org/

 ; Interesting to note, this program runs just as fast (if not faster) in Scheme via Racket, than in Xcode playgrounds (even with boosted: true ! -- up to an amount = ~700.  With boosted: false, (ie both languages implementing a tree recursive process), for any amount over ~75, it's no contest.)*/
